Super-market-store-sales-prediction
==============================

Creating a data-driven solution to reduce costs and increase revenue for supermarket stores. The problem to be solved is the identification of sales patterns in the stores through historical sales data, as well as creating a solution that predicts store sales with better accuracy in order to optimize revenue and act preventively based on data, as the current solution used by analysts uses the average of the last sales to predict the next ones and may not be the best solution.
